# Appendix - Known bugs

This section has spoilers. You may want to find these bugs yourself by testing the application first.

## v001

- what is the point of the 'link to book as list' from the book entity screen? Would it be better to link to the 'books' list?
- The list footer text "Showing All X books." does not change based on the list or menu shown e.g. on 'series' it should probably say "Showing All 3 Series", but instead says 'books' and the number of books in memory.
    - Odd that the number changes, e.g. it is "Showing All 0 books." until the list or table of books is shown, then it becomes "Showing All 364 books." This might imply some 'state' which is bleeding over into the list.
- 404 page has no information, and no menu e.g. https://thepulper.herokuapp.com/apps/pulp/bob


## v009

* delete on the amend forms should probably remove the update buttons or redirect to the list
* we lost the confirm that you want to delete a book, author, series, etc. in the amend form for delete
* forgot to add the output message on series form api usage
   *  bonus points, and if we had it would say "Deleted Publisher" instead of "Deleted Series|
* publisher list insitu removal on delete has been commented out in the code
* did not add the amend book via javascript so the form uses a post
* series amend form via api amends a publisher, not a series
* list totals do not update when removing a list item

## v010

fixed

* delete on the amend forms removes the form details after deletion
* confirm deletion from form - that you want to delete a book, author, series, etc.
* publisher list insitu delete works
* series amend form via api amends series
* update number in list when delete an item
* amend book via javascript


* there is still a bug in v10 where it does not update authors properly because it does not remove any authors - but the #form version does
