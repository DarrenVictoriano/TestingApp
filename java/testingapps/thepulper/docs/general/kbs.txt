# Appendix - Known bugs

This section has spoilers. You may want to find these bugs yourself by testing the application first.

\newpage

## v001

- what is the point of the 'link to book as list' from the book entity screen? Would it be better to link to the 'books' list?
- The list footer text "Showing All X books." does not change based on the list or menu shown e.g. on 'series' it should probably say "Showing All 3 Series", but instead says 'books' and the number of books in memory.
    - Odd that the number changes, e.g. it is "Showing All 0 books." until the list or table of books is shown, then it becomes "Showing All 364 books." This might imply some 'state' which is bleeding over into the list.
- 404 page has no information, and no menu e.g. https://thepulper.herokuapp.com/apps/pulp/bob
- publisher, books, series and years faqs link in list can be triggerd by adding apps/pulp/gui/reports/publishers/list/navigation?faqs (is this intended or should this be inaccessible)
- the list of books for a year can be converted into a table by changing the url - is that intended?
- search for "" with confirm searches selected asks "Do you want to search" before responding with 'you must enter a search term' - better to do that check prior to asking if want to search
- there should be validation on the search term length as it is possible to trigger a 414 - URI too long - from the GUI
- search results does not show a "Showing X books." message at the bottom of the list, which would be helpful to see how many match
- the reports do not have a printable CSS to change the formatting so it is not really a 'good' report
- the reports have the "Showing All 364 books" bug as mentioned earlier


## v003

- help file has bug where version change "Books FAQ page accessible from drop down menu" is listed twice

## v004

## v005

- help content seems to have misleading information i.e. "GUI Uses Form Submissions" the [x] delete form submission was added in version 4

## v009

* delete on the amend forms should probably remove the update buttons or redirect to the list
* we lost the confirm that you want to delete a book, author, series, etc. in the amend form for delete
* forgot to add the output message on series form api usage
   *  bonus points, and if we had it would say "Deleted Publisher" instead of "Deleted Series|
* publisher list insitu removal on delete has been commented out in the code
* did not add the amend book via javascript so the form uses a post
* series amend form via api amends a publisher, not a series
* list totals do not update when removing a list item

## v010

fixed

* delete on the amend forms removes the form details after deletion
* confirm deletion from form - that you want to delete a book, author, series, etc.
* publisher list insitu delete works
* series amend form via api amends series
* update number in list when delete an item
* amend book via javascript


* there is still a bug in v10 where it does not update authors properly because it does not remove any authors - but the #form version does. Might need to use a PUT for this.
* a book can have multiple authors but the API call does not support this, only a single author is provided.
